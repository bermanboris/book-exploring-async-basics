# Communicating with the operating system

**In this chapter I want to dive into:**

- What a System Call is
- Abstractiion levels
- Challenges of writing low-level cross-platform code

## Syscall primer
Communication with the operating system is done through `System Calls` or 
"syscalls" as we'll call them from now on. This is a public API that the operating system provides and that programs we write in "userland" can use to communicate with the OS. 

Most of the time these calls are abstracted away for us as 
programmers by the language or the runtime we use. A language like Rust makes it 
trivial to make a `syscall` though which we'll see below.

Now, `syscalls` is an example of something that is unique to the kernel you're communicating with, but the UNIX family of kernels has many similarities. UNIX systems exposes their through **`libc`**.

Windows on the other hand  uses it's own api, often referred to as WinAPI, and that can be radically different from how the UNIX based systems operate. 

Most often though there is a way to achieve the same things. In terms of functionality you might not notice a big difference but as we'll see below and especially when we dig into how `epoll`, `kqueue` and `IOCP`, they can differ a lot in how this functionality is implemented.

## Syscall example

To get a bit more familiar with `syscalls` we'll implement a very basic one for 
the three architectures: `BSD(macOS)`, `Linux` and `Windows`. We'll also see how this is implemented in three levels of abstractions.

The `syscall` we'll implement is the one used when we write something to `stdout` since that is such a common operation and it's interesting to se how it really works.

### The lowest level of abstraction

For this to work we need to write some [inline assembly](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/book/inline-assembly.html). We'll start by focusing on the instructions we write to the CPU.

> If you want a more torough introduction to inline assembly I can refer you to the [relevant chapter in my previous book](https://cfsamson.gitbook.io/green-threads-explained-in-200-lines-of-rust/an-example-we-can-build-upon) if you haven't read it already.

Now at this level of abstraction, we'll write different code for all three platforms.

On Linux and macOS the `syscall` we want to invoke is called `write`. Both systems operates based on the concept of `file descriptors` and `stdout` is one of these already present when you start a process.

**On Linux a `write` syscall can look like this** \
(You can run the example by clicking "play" in the right corner)
```rust
#![feature(asm)]
fn main() {
    let message = String::from("Hello world from interrupt!\n");
    syscall(message);
}

#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]
fn syscall(message: String) {
    let msg_ptr = message.as_ptr();
    let len = message.len();
    unsafe {
        asm!("
        mov     $$1, %rax   # system call 1 is write on linux
        mov     $$1, %rdi   # file handle 1 is stdout
        mov     $0, %rsi    # address of string to output
        mov     $1, %rdx    # number of bytes
        syscall             # call kernel, syscall interrupt
    "
        :
        : "r"(msg_ptr), "r"(len)

        )
    }
}
```

The code to initiate the `write` syscall on Linux is `1` so when we write `$$1` we're writing the literal value 1 to the `rax` register.

> `$$` in inline assembly using the AT&T syntax is how you write a literal value. A single `$` means you're referring to a parameter so when we write `$0` we're referring to the first parameter called `msg_ptr`.

Coincidentally, placing the value `1` in to the `rdi` register means that we're referring to `stdout` which is the file descriptor we want to write to. This has nothing to do with the fact that the `write` syscall also has the code `1`.

Secondly we pass in the address of our string buffer and the length of the buffer in the registers `rsi` and `rdx` respectively, and call the `syscall` instruction.

> The `syscall` instruction is a rather new one. On the earlier 32-bit systems in the `x86` architecture, you invoked a syscall by issuing a software interrupt `int 0x80`. A software interrupt is considered slow at the level we're working at here so later a seperate instruction for it called `syscall` was added. The `syscall` instruction uses [VDSO](http://articles.manugarg.com/systemcallinlinux2_6.html), which is a memory page attached to each process' memory, so no context switch is necessary to execute the system call.

**On macOS, the syscall will look something like this:** \
(since the Rust playground is running Linux, we can't run this example here)

```rust, no_run
#![feature(asm)]
fn main() {
    let message = String::from("Hello world from interrupt!\n");
    syscall(message);
}

#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]
fn syscall(message: String) {
    let msg_ptr = message.as_ptr();
    let len = message.len();
    unsafe {
        asm!(
            "
        mov     $$0x2000004, %rax   # system call 0x2000004 is write on macOS
        mov     $$1, %rdi           # file handle 1 is stdout
        mov     $0, %rsi            # address of string to output
        mov     $1, %rdx            # number of bytes
        syscall                     # call kernel, syscall interrupt
    "
        :
        : "r"(msg_ptr), "r"(len)
        )
    };
}
```

As you see this is not that different from the one we wrote for Linux, with the exception of the fact that syscall `write` has the code `0x2000004` instead of `1`.

**What about Windows?**

This is a good opportunity to explain why writing code like we do above is a bad idea. 

You see, if you want your code to work for a long time you have to worry about what `guarantees` the OS gives you. As far as I know, both Linux and macOS gives
some guarantees that for example `$$0x2000004` on macOS will always refer to `write` (I'm not sure how strong these guarantees are though). Windows gives absolutely zero guarantees when it comes to low level internals like this.

Windows has changed it's internals numerous times and provides no official documentation. The only thing we got is reverse engineered tables like [this](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/syscalls/nt/64/). That means that what was `write` can be changed to `delete` the next time you run Windows update.

## The next level of abstraction

The next level of abstraction is to use the API which all three operating systems provide for us.

Already we can see that this abstraction helps us remove some code since fortunately for us, in this specific example, the syscall is the same on Linux and on macOS so we only need to worry if we're on Windows and therefore use the `#[cfg(not(target_os = "windows"))]` conditional compilation flag. For the Windows syscall we do the opposite.

### Using the OS provided API in Linux and macOS

You can run this code directly here in the window. However, the Rust playground 
runs on Linux, you'll need to copy the code over to a Windows machine if you 
want to try it out the code for Windows further down.

**Our syscall will now look like this** \
(You can run this code here. It will work for both Linux and macOS)

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    let sys_message = String::from("Hello world from syscall!\n");
    syscall(sys_message).unwrap();
}

// and: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html
#[cfg(not(target_os = "windows"))]
#[link(name = "c")]
extern "C" {
    fn write(fd: u32, buf: *const u8, count: usize) -> i32;
}

#[cfg(not(target_os = "windows"))]
fn syscall(message: String) -> io::Result<()> {
    let msg_ptr = message.as_ptr();
    let len = message.len();
    let res = unsafe { write(1, msg_ptr, len) };

    if res == -1 {
        return Err(io::Error::last_os_error());
    }
    Ok(())
}

```

I'll explain what we just did here. I assume that the `main` method needs no 
comment.


```rust, no_run
#[link(name = "c")]
```

Every Linux installation comes with a version of `libc` which a C-library for 
communicating with the operating system. Having a `libc` with a consistent API 
means they can change the underlying implementation without braking everyones 
code. This flag tells the compiler to link to the "c" library on the system we'
re compiling for.

```rust, no_run
extern "C" {
    fn write(fd: u32, buf: *const u8, count: usize);
}
```

`extern "C"` or only `extern` (C is assumed if nothing is specified) means we're 
linking to specific functions in the "c" library using the "C" calling 
convention. As you'll see on Windows we'll need to change this since it uses a 
different calling convention than the UNIX family.

The function we're linking to needs to have the exact same name, in this case 
`write`. The parameters doesn't need to have the same name but they must be in 
the right order and it's good practice to name them the same as in the library 
you're linking to.

The write function takes a `file descriptor` which in this case is a handle to 
`stdout`. In addition it expects us to provide a pointer to a array of `u8` values and the length of the buffer.

```rust, no_run
#[cfg(not(target_os = "windows"))]
fn syscall_libc(message: String) {
    let msg_ptr = message.as_ptr();
    let len = message.len();
    unsafe { write(1, msg_ptr, len) };
}
```
The first thing we do is to get the pointer to the underlying buffer for our 
string. This will be a pointer of type `*const u8` which matches our `buf` 
argument. The `len` of the buffer corresponds to the `count` argument.

You might ask how we know that `1` is the file handle to `stdout` and where we 
found that value. 

You'll notice this a lot when writing syscalls from Rust. Usually constants are defined in the C header files which we can't link to, so we need to search them up. 1 is always the file descriptor for `stdout` on UNIX systems.

> Wrapping the `libc` functions and providing these constants is exactly what the
> crate [libc](https://github.com/rust-lang/libc) provides for us and why you'll see that used instead of writing
> the type of code we do here.

A call to a FFI function is always unsafe so we need to use the `unsafe` keyword 
here.


### Using the API on Windows

**This syscall will look like this on Windows:** \
(You'll need to copy this code over to a Windows machine to try this out)
```rust, no_run
use std::io;

fn main() {
    let sys_message = String::from("Hello world from syscall!\n");
    syscall(sys_message).unwrap();
}

#[cfg(target_os = "windows")]
#[link(name = "kernel32")]
extern "stdcall" {
    /// https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/getstdhandle
    fn GetStdHandle(nStdHandle: i32) -> i32;
    /// https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/writeconsole
    fn WriteConsoleW(
        hConsoleOutput: i32,
        lpBuffer: *const u16,
        numberOfCharsToWrite: u32,
        lpNumberOfCharsWritten: *mut u32,
        lpReserved: *const std::ffi::c_void,
    ) -> i32;
}

#[cfg(target_os = "windows")]
fn syscall(message: String) -> io::Result<()> {

    // let's convert our utf-8 to a format windows understands
    let msg: Vec<u16> = message.encode_utf16().collect();
    let msg_ptr = msg.as_ptr();
    let len = msg.len() as u32;
    
    let mut output: u32 = 0;
        let handle = unsafe { GetStdHandle(-11) };
        if handle  == -1 {
            return Err(io::Error::last_os_error())
        }

        let res = unsafe { 
            WriteConsoleW(handle, msg_ptr, len, &mut output, std::ptr::null()) 
            };
        if res  == 0 {
            return Err(io::Error::last_os_error());
        }

    assert_eq!(output as usize, len);
    Ok(())
}
``` 

Now, just by looking at the code above you see it starts to get a bit more 
complex, but let's spend som time to go through line by line what we do here as 
well.

```text
#[cfg(target_os = "windows")]
#[link(name = "kernel32")]
```

The first line is just telling the compiler to only compile this if the 
`target_os` is Windows.

The second line is a linker directive, telling the linker we want to link to the 
library `kernel32` (if you ever see an example that links to `user32` that will 
also work).


```rust, no_run
extern "stdcall" {
    /// https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/getstdhandle
    fn GetStdHandle(nStdHandle: i32) -> i32;
    /// https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/writeconsole
    fn WriteConsoleW(
        hConsoleOutput: i32,
        lpBuffer: *const u16,
        numberOfCharsToWrite: u32,
        lpNumberOfCharsWritten: *mut u32,
        lpReserved: *const std::ffi::c_void,
    ) -> i32;
}
```

First of all, `extern "stdcall"`, tells the compiler that we won't use the `C` 
calling convention but use Windows calling convention called `stdcall`.

The next part is the functions we want to link to. On Windows, we need to link 
to two functions to get this to work: `GetStdHandle` and `WriteConsoleW`. 
`GetStdHandle` retrieves a reference to a standard device like `stdout`.

`WriteConsole` comes in two flavors, `WriteConsoleW` that takes in Unicode text 
and `WriteConsoleA` that takes ANSI encoded text. 

Now, ANSI encoded text works fine if you only write English text, but as soon as 
you write text in other languages you might need to use special characters that 
are not possible to represent in `ANSI` but is possible in `utf-8` and our program
will break.

That's why we'll convert our `utf-8` encoded text to `utf-16` encoded Unicode 
codepoints that can represent these characters and use the `WriteConsoleW` function.

```rust, no_run, noplaypen
#[cfg(target_os = "windows")]
fn syscall(message: String) -> io::Result<()> {

    // let's convert our utf-8 to a format windows understands
    let msg: Vec<u16> = message.encode_utf16().collect();
    let msg_ptr = msg.as_ptr();
    let len = msg.len() as u32;
    
    let mut output: u32 = 0;
        let handle = unsafe { GetStdHandle(-11) };
        if handle  == -1 {
            return Err(io::Error::last_os_error())
        }

        let res = unsafe { 
            WriteConsoleW(handle, msg_ptr, len, &mut output, std::ptr::null()) 
            };

        if res  == 0 {
            return Err(io::Error::last_os_error());
        }

    assert_eq!(output, len);
    Ok(())
}
```
The first thing we do is to convert the text to utf-16 encoded text which 
Windows uses. Fortunately Rust has a built in function to convert our `utf-8`
encoded text to `utf-16` code points. `encode_utf16` returns an iterator over 
`u16` code points that we can collect to a `Vec`.

```rust, no_run, noplaypen
let msg: Vec<u16> = message.encode_utf16().collect();
let msg_ptr = msg.as_ptr();
let len = msg.len() as u32;
```

Next we get the pointer to the underlaying buffer of our `Vec` and get the 
length.

```rust, no_run, noplaypen
let handle = unsafe { GetStdHandle(-11) };
   if handle  == -1 {
       return Err(io::Error::last_os_error())
   }
```

The next is a call to `GetStdHandle`. We pass in the value `-11`. The values we 
need to pass in for the different standard devices is actually documented 
together with the `GetStdHandle` documentation:

|Handle|Value|
|------|-----|
|Stdin|-10|
|Stdout|-11|
|StdErr|-12|


Now, we're lucky here, it's not that common that we find this information 
together with the documentation for the function we call but it's very convenient when we do.

The return codes to expect is also documented thoroughly for all functions so we handle potential errors here in the same way as we did for the Linux/macOS syscalls.

```rust, no_run
let res = unsafe { 
    WriteConsoleW(handle, msg_ptr, len, &mut output, std::ptr::null()) 
    };

if res  == 0 {
    return Err(io::Error::last_os_error());
}
```

Next up is the call to the `WriteConsoleW` function. There is nothing too fancy about this.

## The highest level of abstraction

This is simple, most standard libraries provide this abstraction for you. In rust that would simply be:

```rust
println!("Hello world from Stdlib");
```


# Our finished cross platform syscall

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    let sys_message = String::from("Hello world from syscall!\n");
    syscall(sys_message).unwrap();
}

// and: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html

}

#[cfg(not(target_os = "windows"))]
fn syscall(message: String) -> io::Result<()> {
    let msg_ptr = message.as_ptr();
    let len = message.len();
    let res = unsafe { write(1, msg_ptr, len) };

    if res == -1 {
        return Err(io::Error::last_os_error());
    }
    Ok(())
}

#[cfg(target_os = "windows")]

    fn WriteConsoleW(
        hConsoleOutput: i32,
        lpBuffer: *const u16,
        numberOfCharsToWrite: u32,
        lpNumberOfCharsWritten: *mut u32,
        lpReserved: *const std::ffi::c_void,
    ) -> i32;
}

#[cfg(target_os = "windows")]
fn syscall(message: String) -> io::Result<()> {

    // let's convert our utf-8 to a format windows understands
    let msg: Vec<u16> = message.encode_utf16().collect();
    let msg_ptr = msg.as_ptr();
    let len = msg.len() as u32;

    let mut output: u32 = 0;
        let handle = unsafe { GetStdHandle(-11) };
        if handle  == -1 {
            return Err(io::Error::last_os_error())
        }

        let res = unsafe { 
            WriteConsoleW(handle, msg_ptr, len, &mut output, std::ptr::null()) 
            };

        if res  == 0 {
            return Err(io::Error::last_os_error());
        }

    assert_eq!(output, len);
    Ok(())
}
```
